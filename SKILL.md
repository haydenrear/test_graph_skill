description: Work with the test-graph validation system — scaffold a test_graph project into a user repo, add JBang/uv nodes, compose test graphs in build.gradle.kts, run them, aggregate reports. Use whenever the user asks to set up validation nodes, compose a validation graph, or extend an existing test_graph project.

# test-graph skill

You are helping the user build or extend a **test_graph** project — a polyglot validation graph where each node is a small executable script (JBang or uv) that self-describes its metadata and returns a structured `NodeResult`. A Gradle plugin discovers, orders, and runs the graph; reports aggregate through a common envelope.

This whole repo IS the skill. The skill's scripts live in `scripts/`, templates in `templates/`, and the scaffold payload (what gets copied into the user's repo) lives in `project_sdk_sources/`. Read [`constitution.md`](constitution.md) (durable principles) and [`initial-spec.md`](initial-spec.md) (v0 design) for background. Full API / DSL / task reference: [`reference.md`](reference.md).

## Core mental model (60 seconds)

- A **node** is one small unit of validation work. It declares its own `NodeSpec` in-code (id, kind, runtime, `dependsOn`, tags, etc.) and returns a `NodeResult`.
- The **script is the source of truth**. No YAML sidecar. The plugin invokes each script with `--describe-out=<tmp>` to discover metadata, and with full context args to execute.
- A **test graph** is a named composition declared in the scaffolded project's `build.gradle.kts` via `testGraph("X") { ... }`. Each one is a Gradle task — `./gradlew X` runs it.
- Inside a graph, `node("path/to/script")` pulls in a script. Chain `.dependsOn(...)`, `.tags(...)`, `.timeout(...)` to **add rules from the DSL** on top of what the script self-declared. Both sources of edges feed the topo sort.
- Transitives — scripts not listed in the DSL but named in some node's `dependsOn` — are resolved from the registered `sourcesDir("...")`.
- Data flows downstream through an accumulated `Context[]` — each upstream node contributes one `ContextItem { nodeId, data }`. Publish with `NodeResult.publish(k, v)`; read with `ctx.get(upstreamId, key)`.
- Reports are one JSON envelope per node, aggregated into `summary.json` per run, all under `build/validation-reports/<runId>/` of the scaffolded project.

## Two roots the scripts care about

- **`<skill>`** — this repo (where SKILL.md / scripts/ / templates/ / project_sdk_sources/ live).
- **`<test_graph>`** — the scaffolded project the user is operating on (has a `settings.gradle.kts`). Typically lives at `<user-repo>/test_graph/`.

The scripts detect `<test_graph>` automatically by walking up from cwd looking for `settings.gradle.kts`. Always run non-scaffold scripts from inside the scaffolded project.

## Workflows

### 1. Scaffold a new test_graph project

Use when: the user wants to start using this system in a codebase.

```bash
<skill>/scripts/scaffold.py <user-repo-root>
```

Copies the contents of `project_sdk_sources/` (SDKs, plugin, example nodes, Gradle wrapper) into `<user-repo-root>/test_graph/`. Errors if `test_graph/` already exists with content.

After scaffolding:

```bash
cd <user-repo-root>/test_graph
./gradlew validationListGraphs              # confirm the example graph is discovered
./gradlew validationPlanGraph --name=smoke  # dry-run the plan
./gradlew smoke                             # run the example graph
```

### 2. Create a new JBang (Java) node

Run from inside the scaffolded test_graph project.

```bash
<skill>/scripts/new-jbang-node.py <node-id> <kind>
# e.g. <skill>/scripts/new-jbang-node.py checkout.smoke assertion
```

Creates `sources/<ClassName>.java` in the active test_graph project from the skill's template. The class name is derived from the node id.

After creation: edit the file to fill in the body, then reference it from a `testGraph(...) { node("sources/<ClassName>.java") }` block in `build.gradle.kts`. Or leave it unlisted — it'll be pulled in transitively if another DSL-declared node depends on its id.

**Kinds**: `testbed | fixture | action | assertion | evidence | report` — see **Picking a kind** below.

### 3. Create a new uv (Python) node

```bash
<skill>/scripts/new-uv-node.py <node-id> <kind>
# e.g. <skill>/scripts/new-uv-node.py product.seeded fixture
```

Creates `sources/<snake_name>.py` in the active test_graph project. Script name snake-cases the node id.

### 4. Compose a test graph in `build.gradle.kts`

Edit the scaffolded project's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
validationGraph {
    sourcesDir("sources")

    testGraph("smoke") {
        node("sources/user_seeded.py")                      // explicit
        node("sources/LoginSmoke.java")
            .dependsOn("user.seeded")                       // DSL adds an edge
            .tags("regression")                             // DSL adds tags
        // app.running pulled in transitively from script-declared deps
    }
}
```

Every `testGraph(...)` registers a Gradle task with the same name. Multiple graphs are allowed per project.

### 5. Discover graphs and plans

```bash
<skill>/scripts/discover.py                     # list all registered test graphs
<skill>/scripts/discover.py <graph-name>        # plan + adjacency + render DAG to docs/
# equivalent raw Gradle (from inside the scaffolded project):
./gradlew validationListGraphs
./gradlew validationPlanGraph --name=<graph>
./gradlew validationGraphDot  --name=<graph>    # DOT only (pipe-friendly)
```

`discover.py <graph>` writes `<test_graph>/docs/<graph>.dot` and — if graphviz's `dot` is on PATH — renders `<test_graph>/docs/<graph>.png`.

Discovery invokes `--describe-out=<tmp>` on every script referenced by a `testGraph(...)` or reachable through `sourcesDir(...)`. To debug a failing describe:

```bash
jbang sources/MyNode.java --describe-out=/tmp/spec.json
uv run sources/my_node.py --describe-out=/tmp/spec.json
cat /tmp/spec.json
```

### 6. Run a graph

```bash
<skill>/scripts/run.py <graph-name>
# or directly, from inside the scaffolded project:
./gradlew <graph-name>
./gradlew validationReport
```

Output lives at `<test_graph>/build/validation-reports/<runId>/` — one envelope per node under `envelope/`, plus a unified `summary.json` after `validationReport` runs.

## Importing user code into a node

The scaffolded project lives at `<user-repo>/test_graph/`, so `../..` from any node script reaches the user's repo root. That gives node scripts physical access to the user's domain models and helpers via relative paths, without a separate publish step.

**Concrete commented examples are already in the scaffold payload** — copy the patterns:

- [`project_sdk_sources/sources/AppRunning.java`](project_sdk_sources/sources/AppRunning.java) — JBang `//SOURCES` + `//DEPS` block in a header comment
- [`project_sdk_sources/sources/LoginSmoke.java`](project_sdk_sources/sources/LoginSmoke.java) — same, oriented toward a downstream user HTTP client
- [`project_sdk_sources/sources/NetworkPingable.java`](project_sdk_sources/sources/NetworkPingable.java) — minimal variant for a no-deps node
- [`project_sdk_sources/sources/user_seeded.py`](project_sdk_sources/sources/user_seeded.py) — uv `[tool.uv.sources]` block with a user package
- [`templates/jbang-node.java.template`](templates/jbang-node.java.template) and [`templates/uv-node.py.template`](templates/uv-node.py.template) carry the same examples, so `new-jbang-node.py` / `new-uv-node.py` seed every new script with the pointers already in place.
- [`project_sdk_sources/build.gradle.kts`](project_sdk_sources/build.gradle.kts) — commented `testGraph("regression") { ... }` showing how a second graph can reuse scripts with tighter overlays.

Assumed layout (after scaffolding):

```
<user-repo>/
  src/main/java/...         <user project Java sources>
  src/main/python/... or <pkg>/     <user project Python>
  pyproject.toml             (if the user's project is a Python package)
  test_graph/                <- the scaffold lives here
    sources/
      MyNode.java            <- node scripts
      my_node.py
    sdk/java/...
    sdk/python/...
    build.gradle.kts
    gradlew, gradle/
    ...
```

From `test_graph/sources/`, the user repo root is `../..` (up from `sources/` → `test_graph/` → user repo).

### Java (JBang) — use `//SOURCES` + optional `//DEPS`

`//SOURCES` paths in a JBang script are resolved relative to the script file. To pull in the user's Java sources, point at files under `<user-repo>/src/main/java/`:

```java
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//SOURCES ../sdk/java/src/main/java/com/hayden/testgraphsdk/sdk/*.java
//SOURCES ../../src/main/java/com/acme/domain/User.java
//SOURCES ../../src/main/java/com/acme/api/*.java

import com.acme.domain.User;
import com.acme.api.UserClient;
// ... normal Node.run(args, SPEC, ...) body ...
```

Rules of thumb:

- Be specific. Pull in just the files or packages the node needs, not the whole tree.
- Globs are fine: `//SOURCES ../../src/main/java/com/acme/api/*.java`.
- For external JVM libraries (Jackson, OkHttp, Selenium, …) use `//DEPS`:
  ```java
  //DEPS com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.0
  //DEPS org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:4.21.0
  ```
  JBang resolves them from Maven Central. No Gradle dependency wiring needed.

### Python (uv) — use `[tool.uv.sources]` + inline deps

For Python nodes, add your package to the inline script metadata and point `[tool.uv.sources]` at its local path. uv will install it editable into the script's isolated environment:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.10"
# dependencies = ["testgraphsdk", "acme-domain"]
#
# [tool.uv.sources]
# testgraphsdk = { path = "../sdk/python", editable = true }
# acme-domain  = { path = "../..",         editable = true }
# ///

from testgraphsdk import NodeResult, NodeSpec, node
from acme_domain import User, UserClient
```

This assumes `<user-repo>/pyproject.toml` declares the package name (e.g. `name = "acme-domain"`). If the user's project uses a `src/` layout, point at the directory containing `pyproject.toml` — usually still `../..`.

For ad-hoc imports without a packaged project, fall back to `sys.path`:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# <user-repo>/src/main/python reached from test_graph/sources/<this>.py
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "src" / "main" / "python"))

from acme.domain import User
```

Prefer the `[tool.uv.sources]` form — it gives you dependency isolation, editable reinstalls, and cleaner failure modes.

### Keeping node scripts portable

Whether you import user code via `//SOURCES` or `[tool.uv.sources]`, the relative path from `test_graph/sources/<script>` to the user-repo root is always `../..`. Keep the depth at two levels and document any deviation in the script's file header.

## Picking a kind

| Kind        | Use for                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `testbed`   | provisioning an environment (app up, db ready)    |
| `fixture`   | seeding data required by downstream nodes        |
| `action`    | performing an operation (API call, UI click path) |
| `assertion` | checking an invariant holds                      |
| `evidence`  | collecting artifacts (logs, screenshots, dumps)   |
| `report`    | aggregating results into a report shape          |

Prefer the narrowest kind that fits. A single "do everything" `assertion` is almost always wrong — split it.

## Reading and writing context

Every node after the first receives a single `--context=<value>` arg carrying the ordered `List<ContextItem>` for every upstream node in the plan. Inline JSON when small (≤8KB), `@<path>` file reference otherwise — the SDKs handle both transparently.

```java
// upstream (user.seeded):
return NodeResult.pass("user.seeded").publish("userId", userId);

// downstream (login.smoke):
String user = ctx.get("user.seeded", "userId").orElseThrow();
```

```python
# upstream
return NodeResult.pass_("user.seeded").publish("userId", user_id)

# downstream
user = ctx.get("user.seeded", "userId")
```

The canonical record is still the envelope JSON. `ctx.upstream(id)` returns the full envelope if a node needs more than a published primitive (metrics, artifacts, etc).

## When NOT to use this skill

- You are editing the plugin, SDKs, or constitution/spec themselves. That's core-system work — follow the existing patterns in `project_sdk_sources/build-logic/` and `project_sdk_sources/sdk/`; don't use the node templates.
- The user wants a one-off shell command, not a durable validation node. Only graph-worthy work belongs here.

## Authoring rules (condensed)

Before merging work that touches `sources/` or `build.gradle.kts`, confirm:

- [ ] `./gradlew validationListGraphs` + `validationPlanGraph --name=<graph>` show the expected DAG.
- [ ] Node id is dotted and stable (treat like public API).
- [ ] Exactly one `kind` and one `runtime` per node.
- [ ] All dependencies are intentional — either self-declared in the script spec or added via `.dependsOn(...)` in the DSL for reasons you can articulate.
- [ ] Node returns a structured `NodeResult`. Use `.publish(...)` for values downstream should read.
- [ ] Report JSON lands cleanly under `build/validation-reports/<runId>/envelope/`.

## Key anti-patterns

- **One giant script** doing setup + action + assertion. Split into separate nodes.
- **Renaming node ids** without checking downstream impact — ids are public API.
- **Hidden ordering**: `Thread.sleep(...)` / `time.sleep(...)` as a substitute for `dependsOn`. If node B needs A to finish, declare it.
- **Plain stdout reporting** instead of `NodeResult`. The aggregator needs structure.
- **Duplicating `//SOURCES` / `tool.uv.sources` paths** across nodes. The scaffold uses `../sdk/{java,python}/...` for scripts in `sources/`; preserve that layout.
